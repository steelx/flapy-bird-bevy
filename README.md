# flapy-bird-bevy

`the game design is not yet added:`
But, Im trying to create a flappy bird with a twist with some hyper rush gameplay

### Things done so far:
 - ECS
 - Animations system
 - Gravity and Move system (Player) [still needs improvements]
 - Obstacle spawn events (ObstacleSpawnEvent)
 - Game RunState (state.rs)
 - offscreen_deletion_system
 
 
 ### TODO:
  - Random enemy (probably a creeper)
  - Upgrade player movement and gravity
  - more animations and background effects
